I had a lot of issues setting Selenium up with firefox on the Raspberry Pi Zero W, to the point where I gave up and used Chrome. I ended up following the setup guide for a seperate tool, called Instapy (https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy), wich after several modifications, worked. I have included a seperate script for that (PCrawlerZW.py). The first script was written on my laptop on a full version of Ubuntu, so of course it was easy to write and seamless.
